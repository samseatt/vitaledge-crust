#### **Introduction**
**VitalEdge Crust** serves as the gateway and unifying facade for the entire VitalEdge ecosystem. Acting as a centralized access layer, it abstracts the complexity of individual microservices while providing a secure, seamless, and user-centric interface for end-users, administrators, and interconnected systems.

The vision for VitalEdge Crust is to facilitate a cutting-edge personalized healthcare platform by ensuring robust, scalable, and modular access to the entire system. It is designed to be the single point of interaction for all front-end applications (e.g., React-based SPA, Unity-based XR) and to orchestrate communication between the backend services. Crust also ensures aspect-oriented integration, handling critical functionalities like logging, security, encryption, and blockchain recording.
